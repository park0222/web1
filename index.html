  <h2>what is WEB?</h2>
  <p> 한글테스트W3C announced today the joint W3C/SMPTE Workshop on Professional Media Production on the Web, which is being organized as a virtual event during SMPTE’s annual ATC event, 9-18 November 2021.

Professional media assets, including audio-visual masters for television and motion pictures, are increasingly being stored in the cloud. The workshop will connect the web platform and the professional media production communities and explore evolutions of the Web platform to address professional media production requirements, including:

Using Web technologies, like WebCodecs, WebGPU, and Web Audio for professional media production
Understand the unique performance and format requirements of professional media production workflows
Identify gaps in the web platform and standardization opportunities
This joint W3C/SMPTE event will be organized as a combination of pre-recorded talks followed by online discussions on GitHub, and culminating in a series of live sessions in November 2021.

Interested parties are encouraged to submit a proposal for a talk as soon as possible. Deadline for selected speakers to provide their recorded talks is 15 October 2021.

Workshop organizers are also interested in expanding diversity of the program committee to cover other perspectives and regional specificities. Please reach out to François Daoust <fd@w3.org> if you are interested.

The event is free and open to anyone with relevant perspectives on the topic, whether or not W3C/SMPTE members. Please register by 5 November 2021 to be notified of talks availability, of the forum set up to facilitate discussion among registered participants, and of the live sessions logistics. To make sure that live interactions can take place during live sessions, the Program Committee may restrict participation to live sessions based on information provided during registration.</p>
